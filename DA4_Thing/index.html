<h2>Starships</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a multiplayer 2D ship battle simulator
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The way I was able to figure out how to angle the sprites properly as well as handle collision detection for the bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
-I learned a lot about collisions and the best way to handle them. It was difficult at first as I tried many different methods to handle a group of objects colliding with a single sprite, but I eventually figured it out.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
-The easiest part was figure out how to handle the velocity. The hardest part was either angling the sprites properly or handling the collision of the bullets with the player objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    Geometry Wars theme music from Geometry Wars.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
-I was heavily inspired by the Geometry Wars series when designing and implementing this game. The code I used the most was from the bullet phaser example when I was implementing how to create my bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A spaceship battle between two players.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Multiplayer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To create spaceships that are able to do damage eachother.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience the fluid motion of moving the spaceship to attack the other player while also trying to avoid taking damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Player 1:
Up Arrow: Up
Left Arrow: Left
Down Arrow: Down
Right Arrow: Right

Player 2:
W: Up
A: Left
S: Down
D: Right

Shooting happens automatically when moving as to not make the game difficult.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect trying to get behind the other player to be an effecting strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are fan of arcade style space shooters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A couple minutes per round on average.
</li>
