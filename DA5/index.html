<h2>Starship Battlefield</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a 2D ship battle simulator
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The way I was able to figure out how to angle the sprite properly as well as handle collision detection for the bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
-I learned a lot about collisions and the best way to handle them. It was difficult at first as I tried many different methods to handle a group of objects colliding with a single sprite, but I eventually figured it out.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
-The easiest part was figure out how to handle the velocity. The hardest part was either angling the sprites properly or handling the collision of the bullets with the player objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    Geometry Wars theme music from Geometry Wars.

<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
-I was heavily inspired by the Geometry Wars series when designing and implementing this game. The code I used the most was from the bullet phaser example when I was implementing how to create my bullets.
-I iterated on my Digital Assignment 2. I added enemies and changed the way movement worked. I also made the bullet movement smoother for a better gameplay experience.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A spaceship battle between one player and enemie objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Iteration
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To create a spaceship battle simulation against enemies
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience the fluid motion of moving the spaceship to attack enemies while also trying to avoid taking damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Up Arrow: Up
Left Arrow: Left
Down Arrow: Down
Right Arrow: Right
Space: Shoot

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect staying in one place for a certain amount of time then moving to another would work efficiently.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are fan of arcade style space shooters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A couple minutes per round on average.
