            <h2>Bank Heist Escape!</h2>
            
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Originality:</strong>
            It's a distinct variation on the classic arcade running game.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
            The ability to randomly spawn items in certain places and have them cause different events when collided with.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
            I learned a lot about looped events.
            The easist part was coming up with the idea, the hardest part was implementing the event handler.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            Background music from youtube. Sounde effects from soundbible. All other assets were hand made.
            <ul>

            </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
           THe flappy bird clone most resembles my game. I used that tutorial as a base and then changed it to fit a better theme and added some variety.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            See how long you can survive while driving at high speeds and avoiding obstacles.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Theme:</strong>
            Escape.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            User input, randomly generated objects, arcade runner genre.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            This protoype is evaluating the avoidance game mechanic.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
            I want players to challenge themselves to see how far they can go.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            The player moves the car with the left and right arrow keys. Each time a new row of cones spawn the player gets points. The player can also go off ramps to get more points and jump over obstacles. If the player hits spikes, they get pushed back on the track temporarily.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            Since the game is different everytime, there isn't one specific strategy that will work everytime.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
            Your player has just performed a heist at a big bank. Now they must escape in their getaway vehicle while avoiding the obstacles on the road as to not get caught.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            Anyone who likes to play games.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            Average play time is a couple minutes.
            </li>
            
            </ul>
