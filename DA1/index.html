<h2>Ball Avoid</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Besides that I made it on my own, it also incorporates a speed up effect in tune with the audio.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I created my own collision mechanic with the pointer and object.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    I learned a lot about how the javascript interacts with html and the syntax of the language.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    Easiest part was coming up with an idea while the hardest part was implementing it since I had no previous knowledge of this language.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Objects were all my own assests.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The most code I borrowed was from the accelerate to pointer example.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Trying to avoid a ball that increases in speed.

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Speed.

To avoid the ball.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to experience the adrenaline of increasing speed while avoiding the ball.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The main purpose of the game is to move the cursor to avoid the ball that moves towards the player. The ball increases in speed as time goes on.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Moving the mouse circular around the ball seems to be the most effective method
